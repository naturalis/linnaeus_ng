<p>The polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a bear native largely within the Arctic circle encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is the world's largest land carnivore and also the largest bear, together with the omnivorous Kodiak bear, which is approximately the same size.<span>[</span>3<span>]</span> An adult male weighs around 350&ndash;680 kg (770&ndash;1,500 lb),<span>[</span>4<span>]</span> while an adult female is about half that size. Although it is closely related to the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrow ecological niche,  with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for  moving across snow, ice, and open water, and for hunting the seals which make up most of its diet.<span>[</span>5<span>]</span> Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time at sea. Their scientific name means "maritime bear", and derives from this fact. Polar bears can hunt consistently only from sea ice, which is why they spend much of the year on and near the edge of the frozen sea.</p>
<p>The polar bear is classified as a vulnerable species, with 8 of the 19 polar bear subpopulations in decline.<span>[</span>6<span>]</span> For decades, large scale hunting raised international concern for the  future of the species; populations rebounded after controls and quotas  began to take effect. For thousands of years, the polar bear has been a  key figure in the material, spiritual, and cultural life of Arctic indigenous peoples, and the hunting of polar bears remains important in their cultures.</p>
<p>The IUCN now lists global warming as the most significant threat to the polar bear, primarily because the  melting of its sea ice habitat reduces its ability to find sufficient  food. The IUCN states, "If climatic trends continue polar bears may  become extirpated from most of their range within 100 years."<span>[</span>7<span>]</span> The polar bear was listed as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act by the United States Department of the Interior in 2008.</p>
<p><span class="taxon-section-head">Biology</span></p>
<p>The bear family,  Ursidae, is believed to have split off from other carnivorans about 38  million years ago. The Ursinae subfamily originated approximately 4.2  million years ago. According to both fossil and DNA evidence, the polar  bear diverged from the brown bear, Ursus arctos, roughly 150,000 years ago.<span>[</span>16<span>]</span> The oldest known polar bear fossil is a 130,000 to 110,000-year-old jaw bone, found on Prince Charles Foreland in 2004.<span>[</span>16<span>]</span> Fossils show that between ten to twenty thousand years ago, the polar bear's molar teeth changed significantly from those of the brown bear. Polar bears are  thought to have diverged from a population of brown bears that became  isolated during a period of glaciation in the Pleistocene.<span>[</span>17<span>]</span></p>
<p>More recent genetic studies have shown that some clades of brown bear are more closely related to polar bears than to other brown bears,<span>[</span>18<span>]</span> meaning that the polar bear is not a true species according to some species concepts.<span>[</span>19<span>]</span> In addition, polar bears can breed with brown bears to produce fertile grizzly&ndash;polar bear hybrids,<span>[</span>17<span>]</span><span>[</span>20<span>]</span> indicating that they have only recently diverged and are genetically similar.<span>[</span>21<span>]</span> However, because neither species can survive long in the other's ecological niche, and because they have different morphology, metabolism, social and feeding behaviors, and other phenotypic characteristics, the two bears are generally classified as separate species.<span>[</span>21<span>]</span></p>
<p>When the polar bear was originally documented, two subspecies were identified: Ursus maritimus maritimus by Constantine J. Phipps in 1774, and Ursus maritimus marinus by Peter Simon Pallas in 1776.<span>[</span>22<span>]</span> This distinction has since been invalidated.</p>
<p>One fossil subspecies has been identified. Ursus maritimus tyrannus&mdash;descended from Ursus arctos&mdash;became extinct during the Pleistocene. U.m. tyrannus was significantly larger than the living subspecies.<span>[</span>17<span>]</span></p>
