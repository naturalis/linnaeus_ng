new project checklist

== SERVER ==
have a server with:
* accessible database
* fresh checkout from https://github.com/naturalis/linnaeus_ng
  (both automated by puppet)
* SSH-access
  

== COMMAND LINE ==
connect through SSH and:
* make sure database user & password are correct in 
	- /var/www/linnaeusng/configuration/admin/configuration.php
	- /var/www/linnaeusng/configuration/app/configuration.php
  this is automated by puppet so you can probably skip this step

* access database and create tables & base data:
	/var/www/linnaeusng/database/empty_database.sql
	/var/www/linnaeusng/database/base_data.sql
  partly automated by puppet, but very probably not up to date
	
* access database and create project, sysadmin and project role:
	/var/www/linnaeusng/database/new_project_and_user.sql

* optional: if there will be only one project, edit
	/var/www/linnaeusng/configuration/app/constants.php
  and remove the comment prefix // from the line
	//define('FIXED_PROJECT_ID',1);
  this will cause LNG to automatically forward to the project when someone accesses 
	http://my.domain/linnaeus_ng/
