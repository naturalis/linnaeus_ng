NEXUS IMPORT
(import happens in MatrixKeyController)

while exporting from L2, choose the version with tabs, not the "standard"

multiple states are assigned in the matrix as {023} for 0,2,3. i have no idea what 
happens when characters have more than 9 states. the import simply assumes 
it doesn't happen.

also, in the header:
FORMAT MISSING=?  GAP=- SYMBOLS= " 0 1 2 3";
is ignored. the application uses ? as symbol for missing values (hardcoded).

for cleaning up names before resolving (reducing "Genus Flickingeria" to "Flickingeria")
program blindly assumes english ranks names. ranks are not checked to be valid when names are
found. obviously, the taxa already need to exist to be found! the import does NOT create
any taxa. if resolvement fails, the user is notified and the taxon is ignored.

there is no check if there is another matrix with the same name (but import will work nonetheless)
