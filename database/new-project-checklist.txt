new project checklist

== SERVER ==
have a server with:
* accessible database
* fresh checkout from https://github.com/naturalis/linnaeus_ng
  (both automated by puppet)
* SSH-access
  

== COMMAND LINE ==
connect through SSH and:
* make sure database user & password are correct in 
	- /var/www/linnaeusng/configuration/admin/configuration.php
	- /var/www/linnaeusng/configuration/app/configuration.php
  this is automated by puppet so you can probably skip this step
	
* access database and create project, sysadmin and project role.
  there are statement templates in the comment section at the top of:
	/var/www/linnaeusng/database/empty-prepped-database.sql
  replace 
	'Project internal name'
	'Project description'
	'Project visible title'
  in the "insert into projects..." statements with the appropriate values and execute.
  "insert into users..." and "insert into projects_roles_users..." can be
  executed as is.
  if there is more than one project to be created, run the "insert into projects..." and
  "insert into projects_roles_users..." statements multiple times with the appropriate
  values.

* optional: if there will be only one project, edit
	/var/www/linnaeusng/configuration/app/constants.php
  and remove the comment prefix // from the line
	//define('FIXED_PROJECT_ID',1);
  this will cause LNG to automatically forward to the project when someone accesses 
	http://my.domain/linnaeus_ng/
