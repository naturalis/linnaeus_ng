Instructions (10-10-12)

Flora v2.0 export is incomplete, lacking almost 1000 images and images linked to Identify states. These scripts correct both issues. 

Make sure $projectId and database connection are set properly in include_me.php before running.

PS: currently it's still necessary to manually copy all multimedia to the appropriate folder before running the scripts. The missing images are NOT yet copied during import.
